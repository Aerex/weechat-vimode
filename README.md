vimode
======
An attempt to add a vi-like mode to WeeChat, which provides some common vi key
bindings and commands, as well as normal/insert modes.
See the comments in vimode.py for help/usage.

You can get the script from the WeeChat scripts repo as well, but this might
be more up to date.

Patches welcome.
